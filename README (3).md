# Arrhenius Equation Analysis

This project provides a Python script for analyzing the impact of activation energy and temperature on reaction rates, based on the integrated form of the Arrhenius equation. It calculates the ratio \(D_2/D_1\) and the percentage increase of \(D_2\) over \(D_1\) across a range of activation energies and temperatures, offering insights into the temperature dependence of reaction rates.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your machine along with the following Python libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

### Running the Script

To execute the analysis, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python arrhenius_equation_analysis.py
```

Make sure you're in the correct directory where the script is located.

## Features

- Calculation of \(D_2/D_1\) ratios and percentage increases using the Arrhenius equation.
- Generation of data for a range of activation energies (20 kJ/mol to 120 kJ/mol) and temperatures (15°C to 40°C).
- Visualization of the impact of activation energy and temperature difference on the reaction rate.

## Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The core programming language
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - Used for efficient numerical calculations
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Used for data manipulation and analysis
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Used for generating plots and visualizations
